â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/          # Authentication-specific
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ events/        # Event management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ profile/       # User profiles
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/            # Shared UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/             # Route components
â”œâ”€â”€ services/          # API services
â””â”€â”€ hooks/             # Custom hooks
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
