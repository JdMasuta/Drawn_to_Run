## Session 1 - Project Foundation and Initial Setup
**Date**: August 2024  
**Objective**: Establish project foundation with Vite + React + TypeScript, configure Netlify deployment, and set up Neon PostgreSQL database

### Implementation Steps
1. **Project Initialization**: Created Vite + React 18 + TypeScript project structure
2. **Core Dependencies**: Installed React Router, TailwindCSS, React Query, Zustand
3. **Database Setup**: Created Neon PostgreSQL database with comprehensive schema
4. **Infrastructure Configuration**: Set up Netlify deployment and environment variables
5. **Basic Architecture**: Established folder structure and initial components

### Technical Details
- **Files Created**: Project foundation, `src/` directory structure, `netlify.toml`, database schema
- **Architecture Decisions**: 
  - Chose React Query for server state management
  - Zustand for client state management
  - TailwindCSS for styling system
  - Netlify Functions for serverless backend

### Problems Encountered
1. **TypeScript Build Errors**: Initial configuration had compilation issues
2. **Netlify Deployment Issues**: Build process failing due to TypeScript configuration

### Solutions Applied
1. **TypeScript Configuration**: 
   - Created separate `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`

### Implementation Steps
1. **Database Integration**: Set up @netlify/neon integration with proper connection handling
2. **Authentication Endpoints**: Created register, login, logout, and user profile endpoints
3. **JWT Implementation**: Set up token generation, validation, and refresh mechanisms
4. **API Architecture**: Established router, controller, and service layer patterns
5. **Security Implementation**: Password hashing with bcrypt, input validation with Zod

### Technical Details
- **Files Created**: 
  - `netlify/functions/auth-*` endpoints
  - `src/controllers/AuthController.ts`
  - `src/services/authService.ts` 
  - `src/store/authStore.ts`

### Problems Encountered
1. **API 404 Errors**: Authentication endpoints returning 404 instead of function responses
2. **Database Connection Issues**: Intermittent connection failures to Neon database
3. **Netlify Functions Structure**: Complex nested directory structure causing routing issues

### Solutions Applied
1. **Netlify Functions Routing Fix**:
   - Flattened function directory structure from nested to flat
   - Updated `netlify.toml` redirects to match new structure
   - **Generalized Pattern**: Keep Netlify Functions flat to avoid routing complexity

2. **Database Connection Stability**:
   - Implemented connection pooling and retry logic
   - Added proper error handling and connection cleanup
   - **Generalized Pattern**: Always implement connection pooling for serverless functions

3. **API Architecture Refactor**:

3. **Form Validation Issues**: Complex validation for event dates and capacity

### Solutions Applied
1. **Database Query Optimization**:
   - Fixed SQL queries with proper JOIN operations
   - Added error handling for malformed requests
   - **Generalized Pattern**: Always test database queries in isolation before integration

2. **API Response Standardization**:

   - **Generalized Pattern**: Test units that match your actual implementation format

3. **Component Test Fixes**:
   - Fixed React import issues and React Query configuration
   - Split tests to avoid cache conflicts between test cases
   - **Generalized Pattern**: Isolate test cases with proper cleanup and unique data
