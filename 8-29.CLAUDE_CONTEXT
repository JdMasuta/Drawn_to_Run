# Claude Context Document - August 29, 2025

## Project: Drawn to Run
**Status**: Active Development - Phase 2 Testing Complete
**Last Updated**: August 29, 2025

## Current Context

### Project Overview
Building a modern web application for managing running events (5K, 10K, marathons) with a daily.dev-inspired interface, Strava integration, and comprehensive event management features.

**Tech Stack**:
- Frontend: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- Backend: Netlify Functions + Neon PostgreSQL
- Deployment: Netlify (Production: https://drawn-to-run.netlify.app)

### Recent Work Completed
Just successfully resolved critical Netlify function deployment issues:
- **Fixed function structure**: Flattened nested directory structure (`events/[id]/index.ts` â†’ `events-id.ts`)
- **Resolved naming issues**: Renamed functions to remove square brackets (Netlify restriction)
- **Updated import paths**: Changed `../../_shared/` to `./_shared/` for all moved functions
- **Fixed redirects**: Updated netlify.toml to route to new function names
- **Verified deployment**: All functions now bundle and deploy successfully
- **Confirmed API functionality**: Event detail API endpoints working properly
- **Verified UI**: Event detail pages now load completely with full data

### Current Development Phase
- **Phase 2**: âœ… Test event details API endpoint functionality (COMPLETED)
- **Phase 3**: ðŸ”„ Test interactive features (registration, comments, sharing) (IN PROGRESS)
